With that said, I have this tool which we can query both. If you wish to check the demo page, visit [here](https://tools.kurtobando.com/tools/)

### How to use it? 
Enter a domain name on the search area, then click on Dig Records. This should return DNS result and whois result respectively. For example:
[![Tool Result](https://snag.gy/co1A34.jpg "Tool Result")](https://snag.gy/co1A34.jpg "Tool Result")

### Tools used?
1. **UIKit** as CSS Framework.
2. **Vanilla Javascript** for simple DOM Manipulation.
