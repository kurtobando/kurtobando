# kurtobando.com
Hi, my name is Kurt. An aspiring cinematographer and front-end developer, founder of cityescape.ph

UIKit CSS framework was used for this project. The goal was to explore the said framework on my first portfolio page. At this point, kurtobando.com has been updated to its custom CSS rules. No framework used at the moment, which means, this repository is just for documentation.
